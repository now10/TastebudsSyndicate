					<description><![CDATA[I won some of these seeds from London Seed Centre in one of their monthly give-aways (my favourite seed shop) so a big thank you to them and especially to Tastebudz for giving me the chance to try their genetics.
This Cherry Cheesecake Auto was an awesome grow giving me a dried weight of 12.2 ounces (my 2nd ever best grow in 20 years) and thats 12.2 Oz of real quality bud.
I have 20 years experience growing cannabis in organic living soil but wanted to try my hand at hydroponics so I used a 25 litre beer brew butt with an old fish tank air bubbler to grow in.
This is also the 1st auto flowering cannabis strain that I have tried since Think Different 1st came out (quite a few years ago I think) so am also very inexperienced with this type of plant.
I used Advanced Nutrients Sensi Grow &#038; Bloom at a maximum strength of 50% along with Cannazym and very small amounts of Dr Forests amazing XXX Seaweed Extract and Big Bud and Plagron Sugar Royal in flower and was grown in a 4x4 tent under a Mars Hydro 2000 W led (the square one) and paying close attention to VPD.
The plant was cut exactly 11 weeks from the day the seed cracked and was put in a peat plug.
It was an incredibly easy grow and it got huge, about 4 feet high but nearly the same width, you would struggle to fit 2 plants in a 4x4 grow tent.
I did some lolli-popping but in hindsight I wish I had scrogged it too, it was so big and spread everywhere I had to support a lot of side branches with string to the tent roof as the weight of bud was dragging them down and making it spread even wider.
I was adding 20 litres of new water every 4 days in late flower, this is a thirsty girl but it really paid off especially considering my complete lack of experience in hydroponics but thank Youtube for that.
My only mistake was completely forgetting I need to flush in hydroponics (not necessary in organic soil) so I missed that step and it did definitely have a negative effect on taste but not so much that it is un-smokeable, it is still a very nice sweet and fruity smoke with a very nice melt into the sofa hit but done properly this would be delicious so I shall do another grow soon but in organic living soil and I expect a higher yield and vastly improved flavour from that grow.
I can not recommend these seeds highly enough, so easy to grow and giving a truly massive crop of quality bud.
My only complaint with this plant was the leaf to bud ratio was very high. I was often removing about a pound of fan leaves every other day (thats not an exaggeration) during flower to keep the bud sites adequately exposed to light and this also meant trimming (done dry) was very tedious due to the massive amount of leaves still remaing.
Considering the end result and the ease of grow this is a very minor complaint and may just be phenotypic or due to my very simple grow schedule and may be different in living soil but even if I have to do that much trimming again its a small price to pay for the sheer volume of dry bud I have from it.
I will definitely be trying something else from Tastebudz as I am very impressed with their Cherry Chessecake Auto.
Very beginner friendly but I bet more experienced hydro growers than me could end up with truly astonishing amounts of excellent quality and very yummy dried bud.
Thank you again Tastebudz, you guys Rock !]]></description>
